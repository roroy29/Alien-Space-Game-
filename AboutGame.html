            <h2>About My Game</h2>
            <p>This game was designed by me, Roshan Roy, for a university assignment.
                 I wrote most of the code for this game and also used some code from websites
                  that I referenced. These websites are commented on my jscript.js file and I will also reference these 
                  below. </p>
            <h3>Game Objects </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Player - The blue alien in the red ufo.  </li>
                <li>Arena - The red box in which all the aliens contain.</li>
                <li>Obstacles - The 12 green aliens in the pink ufo.  </li>
                <li>Points - The pink ufos touch the bottom red bar you get +1 points.  </li>
            </ul>
